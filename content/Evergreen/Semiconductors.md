## Photolithography
- Used to _draw_ a pattern onto a silicon wafer.
- Followed by etching where we make the drawings physical.

- Starts off by **coating** the silicon substrate in a layer of photoresist.
	- Photoresist is a light sensitive chemical that either hardens (negative) or becomes soluble (positive) when exposed to light.
	- The photoresist is applied evenly on the wafer using a **spin-coater**.
		- A spin coater is like a vinyl music player.
		- We put a few drops of the spin coater in the center of the wafer and spin it.
		- All the excess photoresist flies off the wafer, forming a thin layer of the resist.
- We then **expose** the photoresist to a pattern of intense light.
	- The exposure to light causes some chemical reactions on the photoresist which, depending on whether it's a positive or negative photoresist, weaken or harden  the layer of photoresist exposed to the light.
	- The light is shined onto the substrate in a pattern made by using a photomask (patterned covering).
- After exposure, we remove some of the photoresist using a **developer solution**.
	- Surface exposed to light when using positive photoresist becomes soluble.
	- While the unexposed surface remains soluble if using negative photoresist.
	- The developer solution is also delivered on a spinner like photoresist.
	- The section of substrate exposed cuz of removing the photoresist is the part that gets etched away.

- After the photoresist is no longer useful it is removed from the substrate using a _resist stripper_ that chemically alters the resist such that it no longer sticks to the substrate surface or using plasma ashing (using oxygen to oxidize the resist).
## Etching
- Etching _converts_ the drawn patterns to traces (think pcb) on the substrate.
- [Etching Illustrated](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Photolithography_etching_process.svg/280px-Photolithography_etching_process.svg.png) (why are we etching oxide over the substrate?)

- Not yet sure why we do etching. I'm guessing it provides pathways for current to flow through. Pathways we can control.
### Wet Etching
- After removing sections of photoresist, we immerse the material in an etchant solution to essentially eat away the layer of oxide exposed.
- Wet etching seeps (smth like that) underneath the layer of photoresist and etches away sections it's not supposed to.
	- This tendency to get under the resist is called bias.
	- Isotropic etching (when effectiveness of etching is same regardless of direction) leads to high bias. We want etching toward/under resist to be low (orientation dependent etching).
### Plasma Etching (dry)
- We make plasma by using RF to ionize gas in a vacuum chamber.
- The ions are then accelerated to the surface of the substrate. Now:
- **Physical Etching (sputtering):** we literally blast the surface with ions which physically remove the atoms of the oxide by transferring momentum. I'm guessing this is the one done in low pressure.
- **Chemical Etching:** stuff in the plasma reacts with the surface material.
