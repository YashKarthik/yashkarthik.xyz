- This changes based on whether battery is charging or discharging.

- Cathode is the terminal where electrons are gained.
	- Cathode Current Departs (CCD)
- Anode is the terminal where electrons are lost.

- During discharge, the positive terminal is cathode.
	- Since the current flows _out_ of the positive terminal, electrons are gained.
- During  charging, the negative terminal is cathode.
	- Cuz the current flows into the positive terminal to charge up the battery, hence current must be flowing out of the negative terminal.

- Cathode in vacuum tubes in vacuum tubes loses electrons. It's called such because of historical reasons (cathode ray tubes).
