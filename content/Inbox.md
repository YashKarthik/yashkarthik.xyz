- Selecting from array like objects in hardware is where we use de-muxes and muxes for outputting.
- Register is to the stack, what RAM is to Memory. Computer : EVM.
- D register stores actual data. M is a pointer to slot in Memory. A can store data or a pointer to a word in Memory. The address of the slot M points to is given by the value stored in A. We can modify the contents of Memory slot using A.

What’s the best way to get to know you as a person?
What’s your life story?
What traits do you envy/value in those around you?
What do you feel insecure about? (This one is higher variance - I don’t recommend leading with it!)
What do you value in friendships? What are the best ways they add to your life?
How, historically, have you become close to people?
If you could design a personal set of social norms for how your friends interact with you, what would they be?
How would other people describe you? How does this compare to how you want to be perceived?
What in life do you get truly excited about?

I'm building a computer from scratch.

I took a class on digital circuits in my second semester at Waterloo and I learned about hardware-based compute–doing the computation on hardware instead of software. This was such a different way of thinking about performing operations!

After playing with simulations and some toy projects, I figured why not just build a computer from scratch! And by "from scratch", I mean using just logic gates.

Designing robust engineering systems that last requires deep knowledge which can't be learned by just reading a textbook or by attending a bootcamp. Building a computer from scratch exposes me to the entire compute stack, forcing me to get competent.

The skills gained here will help me build robust systems for the future.

I have been fiddling with robotics and computer hardware since I was in 8th grade. Written firmware for Waterloo's drones team and Formula Electric team. Previously wrote code and designed electrical systems for high school's robotics team.

Already started the project and built the ALU on a breadboard in ~3 weeks and demoed at Socratica Symposium (w24): https://youtu.be/xQFHZhmiJuA?t=6276).

My moat is that I'm crazy enough to build complex systems like a computer from first principles.
