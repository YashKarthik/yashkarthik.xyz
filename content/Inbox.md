I'm building a computer from scratch.

I took a class on digital circuits in my second semester at Waterloo and I learned about hardware-based computeâ€“doing the computation on hardware instead of software. This was such a different way of thinking about performing operations!

After playing with simulations and some toy projects, I figured why not just build a computer from scratch! And by "from scratch", I mean using just logic gates.

Designing robust engineering systems that last requires deep knowledge which can't be learned by just reading a textbook or by attending a bootcamp. Building a computer from scratch exposes me to the entire compute stack, forcing me to get competent.

The skills gained here will help me build robust systems for the future.

I have been fiddling with robotics and computer hardware since I was in 8th grade. Written firmware for Waterloo's drones team and Formula Electric team. Previously wrote code and designed electrical systems for high school's robotics team.

Already started the project and built the ALU on a breadboard in ~3 weeks and demoed at Socratica Symposium (w24): https://youtu.be/xQFHZhmiJuA?t=6276).

My moat is that I'm crazy enough to build complex systems like a computer from first principles.
